    <p> <b> The Hyper Text Markup language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. it can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and scripting languages such as javascript.</b></p>
    



    <br>

    <p> <b> Web browsers recieve HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.HTML desribes the structure of a we page semantically and orginally included cues for the appearance of the document. </b></p>
<br>
<p><b>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as javascirpt, which affects the behaviour and content of web pages.inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of the content.The World Wide Web Consortium(W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio primarily using the element in colloboration with javascript.</br></p>

<h2><a name="css">2.CSS</a><dd>[Cascading Style Sheets]</dd></h2> <img src="css logo.png" alt="">

<p><b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for decribing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a comerstone technology of the World Wide Web,alongside HTML and JavaScript.</b> </p>
<br>
<p>  <b>CSS is designed to enable the presentation and content, including layouts,colors, and fonts. This seperation can improve content accessibility provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a seperate css file, which reduces compexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the css file to be catched to improve the page load speed between the pages that shares the files and its formatting.  </b></p>
<br>
<p><b>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device</b></p>

<h2><a name="javascript">3.JAVASCRIPT</a></h2> <img src="javascript logo.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<p><b>JavaScript  often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</b></p>
 <br>
 <p><b></b>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
<br>
<p><b>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</b></p>
